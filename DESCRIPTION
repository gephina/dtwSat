Description: Provides a robust approach to land use mapping using multi-dimensional 
    (multi-band) satellite image time series. By leveraging the Time-Weighted Dynamic 
    Time Warping (TWDTW) distance metric in tandem with a 1-NN classifier, the package 
    provides functions to produce land use maps based on distinct seasonality patterns, 
    typically observed in the phenological cycles of vegetation. The TWDTW algorithm is 
    described in Maus et al. (2016) <doi:10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2517118> and 
    Maus et al. (2019) <doi:10.18637/jss.v088.i05>. A key strength of TWDTW is its ability 
    to recognize patterns with only a minimal training set, achieving notable accuracy. 
    The package features tools for generating temporal patterns for various land cover types, 
    conducting land use mapping, and visualizing the outcomes.
