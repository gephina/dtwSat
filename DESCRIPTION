Description: Provides an implementation of the Time-Weighted Dynamic Time
    Warping (TWDTW) method for land cover mapping. TWDTW computes the similarity between 
    satellite image time series with a set of known temporal patterns 
    (e.g. phenological cycles of the vegetation).
    'dtwSat' offers the user methods to create temporal patterns for land cover types, 
    perform TWDTW analysis for satellite datasets, visualize the results of the analysis, 
    produce land cover maps, create temporal plots for land cover change, and compute 
    accuracy metrics.
